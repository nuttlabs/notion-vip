With the August 2023 release of Notion 2.32, the team took a more engaging and useful approach to listing new features. Across online channels, they posted the above video, where a different Notioneer explains a feature.

Here’s each teacher with its timestamp:

- **00:11** — Invite users to a page from a Slack directory
- **00:24** — “Favorite” AI prompts for easy reuse
- **01:04** — Include dependents when shifting timeline items
- **01:29** — Independent “Share” tab for web publishing
- **01:36** — Permission levels for internal links
- **01:48** — New integrations and gallery
- **02:13** — Connected properties display previews of Google Drive and Figma resources
- **02:36** — Automatically sort `Select` and `Multi-Select` options
- **02:51** — Quick add end dates with `Shift` + `Click`
