## My #1 Rule for Using Notion

From my earliest days with Notion, I’ve maintained a fundamental principle that’s continuously revalidated. Drawn from proven methodologies and leading productivity apps, it propels any Notion workspace. 

In the simplest terms, the rule is to **structure all information in related master databases**, then **access it intuitively through contextual views**.

In a succinct four minutes, [here](https://www.notion.vip/insights/the-1-rule-for-every-notion-workspace)’s a deeper dive into where the principle came from, what it means, and why it’s so powerful.

—New Features
## “Notion Projects” Explained—with Essential Tips

With Notion’s latest release came Notion Projects. Despite its high utility and heavy promotion, many users continue wondering whether it’s a new feature, a template or philosophy.

In fact, it’s all three.

In [this guide](https://www.notion.vip/insights/notion-projects-explained-with-crucial-recommendations), I make sense of Notion Projects and offer crucial recommendations for maximizing the system. In doing so, I explain other new features, like the the `Unique ID` property type and `AI autofill`.

—Formulas
## Learn Formulas Like an Insider
Over the past few months, I’ve helped groups of key Notion stakeholders learn the app’s most advanced features. That includes a thorough introduction to formulas and the most useful functions. Each of those lessons—[formulas](https://www.notion.vip/insights/notion-stakeholder-series-intro-to-formulas) and [functions](https://www.notion.vip/insights/notion-stakeholder-series-frequent-functions)—are now published for all users.

Notion serves to organize information and streamline workflows. Formulas bolster those objectives considerably. They boost accuracy and efficiency while minimizing friction and redundancy. They automate calculations and reveal insights. 

Any workspace without formulas is underutilizing Notion. Spend time learning them so you can _save_ time long-term. You’ll see that the core principles are applicable throughout computing.
