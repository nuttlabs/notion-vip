Notion’s Wiki feature combines the flexibility of pages with the structure of databases. 
- One view acts as a standard page, where you can display any block, wherever you want.
- Other views display only the “child” pages that occur within the page, just as you’d see pages as items in a database.
- Like any database, you can choose layouts and assign filtering, sorting and grouping rules, along with a multitude of other settings.

If you’ve seen any of my resources, you know that my #1 rule is to utilize the structure of databases for all information in your workspace rather than freely entering content. So you can imagine how much I love the ability to do both with Notion Wikis.

But there’s actually a hidden capability of Wikis that makes them so powerful. It’s the reason I recommend using a Wiki as the top-level page in any workspace, just as I’ve done in the Bulletproof Workspace template that’s so widely adopted by Notion users. I’ll explain that hidden feature after we walk through the fundamentals of Wikis.

Within in page that’s not a database item, you can `Turn into wiki` from the `•••` menu.
